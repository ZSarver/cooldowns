## FAQ

1. Why?

  I have two problems.

  1. I love coffee.
  1. Drinking coffee too frequently gives me headaches.
  
  The purpose of this webapp is to give me an MMO-style ability hotbar for *life*, so that I can mangage my coffee consumption and anything else that I will want to take a break from after doing.

1. It's not very functional...

  That's not a question, but it's a work in progress. It technically does what it's supposed to, it's just ugly as sin. It's also missing a lot of niceties, like for example your ability hotbar has no persistence.

## Planned features

* Be a hell of a lot prettier.
* Persistence!
